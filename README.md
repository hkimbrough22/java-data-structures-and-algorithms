# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

**Author**: Haustin Kimbrough
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

This is the space where I complete my code challenges for Code 401 Java.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This is just a Java application for now.

### Code Challenges
1. [Array Reverse](./codechallenges/CC01/README.md)
2. [Insert-Shift Array](./codechallenges/CC02/README.md)
3. [Binary-Search Array](./codechallenges/CC03/README.md)

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
