# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

**Author**: Haustin Kimbrough
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

This is the space where I complete my code challenges for Code 401 Java.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This is just a Java application for now.
