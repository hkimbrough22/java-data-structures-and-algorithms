## tree_intersection

Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

Input:
![Binary Tree 1](BT1.png)

![Binary Tree 2](BT2.png)

Output:
`100,160,125,175,200,350,500`
