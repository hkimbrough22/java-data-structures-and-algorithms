## Graphs
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

### addNode
- Arguments: value
- Returns: The added node
- Add a node to the graph
### addEdge
- Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
- Returns: nothing
- Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
- If specified, assign a weight to the edge
- Both nodes should already be in the Graph
### getNodes
- Arguments: none
- Returns all the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
### getNeighbors
- Arguments: node
- Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
- Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
### size
- Arguments: none
- Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Edge and Vertex
- This class also adds boilerplate Edge and Vertex classes
